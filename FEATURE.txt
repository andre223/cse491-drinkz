STORY

Nik is hosting his 21st birthday party, and he had spent a lot of money during
the month and realizes he doesnt have a whole lot of money to put down to buy
the stuff he would like to have.

He decides to make a list of those things and guests can comment by saying yes,
if they choose to bring that item, And a counter will be set up for the number
of people who are willing to bring that item.

*He also wants people to rate his what his party will be like based on the information put on the website.

The list of things could have DRINKZ(obviously) and food items. 


IMPLEMENTATION

I would create a seperate party page where the host posts all the liquor, music
list, and food items that are going to be at the party, and a seperate page
that lists the things he would like for people to bring.

On the party home page the guests can give a rating based on what they think the party is going to be like.


WEB INTERFACE

I am thinking of having a table for the things the host going to provide and a
table for the things he would like people to bring. Form for each item, where
the guests can type the item number associated with the item that they
would like to bringing ,and a form for the total
number of people who gave each of the ratings, which returns a total number for
that particular rating.
